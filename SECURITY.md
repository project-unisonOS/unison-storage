# Security

The storage service is part of the UnisonOS core and is responsible for working memory, long-term storage, and vault functionality.

For overall security and privacy guidance, including how storage fits into the secure profile model, see:

If you discover a security issue in unison-storage, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
